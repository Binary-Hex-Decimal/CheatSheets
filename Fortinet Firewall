Use one of the following commands:

execute backup config management-station <comment>

Backup to USB:

execute backup config usb <backup_filename> [<backup_password>]

Backup FTP:

execute backup config ftp <backup_filename> <ftp_server> [<port>] [<user_name>] [<password>]

Backup TFTP:

execute backup config tftp <backup_filename> <tftp_servers> <password>

Use the same commands to backup a VDOM configuration by first entering the commands:

config vdom

edit <vdom_name>

RESTORE CONFIG:
execute restore config management-station normal 0
or:
execute restore config usb <filename> [<password>]

FTP:
execute restore config ftp <backup_filename> <ftp_server> [<port>] [<user_name>] [<password>]

TFTP:
execute restore config tftp <backup_filename> <tftp_server> <password>

BACKUP Certificate:
execute vpn certificate local export tftp <cert_name> <filename> <tftp_ip>

where:

<cert_name> is the name of the server certificate.
<filename> is a name for the output file.
<tftp_ip> is the IP address assigned to the TFTP server host interface.
