Firewall – Overview
•	Produce a high level network diagram.
•	Identify Subnets.
•	Group subnets into zones.
•	Primary and Secondary firewalls in a clust or HA (High availability) as redundancy.
Firewall – Rules
•	Disable Insecure protocols telnet, ssh, snmp and ftp. Were they cannot be disabled then redule the attack service by minimising access.
•	Enable rule to hide firewall from network scans i.e Block ICMP.
•	Avoid rule for destination and source that are set to any.
•	impliment Deny by defualt rule.
•	Good naming and descriptions when implementing firewall rules.
•	SAN checklist to Restrict/block the following ports:
Service	Port	Port number
DNS Zone Transfers	TCP	53
TFTP Daemon	UDP	69
Link	TCP 	87
BSD Unix	TCP	512-514
Small service	TCP and UDP	20 and below
SMTP (except external mail relays)	TCP	25
NetBIOS in Windows NT	TCP and UDP	135
NetBIOS in Windows NT	UDP	137 and 138
IMAP	TCP	143
LDAP	TCP and UDP	389
Syslog	UDP	514
Cisco AUX port	TCP	2001
Cisco AUX port (Stream)	TCP	4001
Cisco AUX port (binary) 	TCP	6001
Common high order HTTP ports	TCP	8000, 8080, and 8888

 
Firewall – Management
•	Periodic backups as a snapshot of configuration.
•	Periodic updates to firewall software and ad-hoc updates for known vulnerabilities.
•	keep management access to a minimum.
•	Use non-standard accounts and passwords.
•	Password complexity.
•	Initiate MFA.
•	Role-Based access i.e assisgning user to groups etc.
Firewall – Audit
•	Change Management to apply to Configuration changes
•	Enable system auditing and method of passing logs these to a centralised location i.e Siem.
•	Aduit logs periodiclly  to access threat landscape.
•	Review and test firewall rules periodically.
