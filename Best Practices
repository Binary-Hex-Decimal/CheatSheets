Storage Area Network (SAN)
--------------------

Security:
-Segregation: VLAN or segregating SAN network.
-Encryption: Protect data both at rest and in transit.
-Access Controls: Use strong access controls to limit who can access the SAN and what they can be done.

Maintenance/Monitoring
-Regular Review in terms of security and overall set-up
-Identify and track Performance baseline

Documenting:
-Create a schematic of your network to aid in management and troubleshooting


Computer Networks:
--------------------

Security:
Permissions:
-MFA enabling were possible and applicable.
-Implement the principle of granting users minimum level of access.
-Network segmentation i.e VLAN to isolate networks and limit the spread of potential breaches. This would also assist with mangement of network flow.
-Deploy Firewall and IDS utilising packet inspection to idnetify potential suspicious traficc.
-Encrypting Data in transit and at rest to protect again data exilfiltration.

Management:
-Regular updates/patching deployement/testing maintaining rollback configurations. Either periodically or ad-hoc when major vilnerabilities are identifed.
-Regular INTERNAL/EXTERNAL Penetration Testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
-Educate employees about security best practices i.e passwordm phishing to limit these types of threats. 
-Continuous Monitoring and review to verifyuser and device activity.
-Documentation to aid in Network troubleshooting.
-Test implemented mechanism i.e failover processes peridocally.
