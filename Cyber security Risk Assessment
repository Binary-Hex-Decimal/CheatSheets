What is Cyber security Risk:
Cybersecurity risk refers to the potential loss or damage resulting from a cyberattack or data breach. It involves identifying and assessing threats and vulnerabilities within an organization’s digital systems and networks. 

Examples:
 -Ransomware
 -Malware
 -Insider threats
 -Phishing attacks

Risk Assesment Approaches:

Avoid:
 -Avoiding Untrusted Software.
 -Zero-Trust permissions.
 -Network Segmentation i.e Vlan.

Mitigate:
 -Risk Assessments
 -Implement Network Access Controls i.e MFA,Zero-Trust permissions.
 -Regular Software Updates.
 -Employee Training.
 -Encryption: Protect sensitive data by encrypting it both in transit and at rest.
 -Backup Data.
 -Monitor and Respond.
 -Implement Security Policies.

Transfer:
 -Outsourcing certain IT or security functions to third-party providers i.e MSP,Cloud etc.
 -Cyber Insurance: Purchasing insurance policies that cover financial losses from cyber incidents, including data breaches, legal fees, and recovery costs.

Accept:
 -Accepting the residual risk after implementing all feasible security controls. This is a strategic decision based on a thorough risk assessment.
 -Accept risks that are low-impact, have a low likelihood of occurring, or when the cost of mitigation is too high compared to the potential damage1.
 -Legacy Systems: Continuing to use older systems that are costly to upgrade but have minimal exposure to critical threats.
 -Review and Reassessment: Regularly review accepted risks to ensure they remain within acceptable levels and reassess them as the threat landscape evolves2.

Frameworks:
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-39, (Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View):
Provides comprehensive guidance for managing information security risks across an organization. Here are the key points:

Components:
 -Risk Framing: Establishing the context for risk-based decisions.
 -Risk Assessment: Identifying and evaluating risks to information systems.
 -Risk Response: Determining appropriate actions to address identified risks.
 -Risk Monitoring: Continuously overseeing the risk environment and the effectiveness of risk responses2.
 -Integration with Other Standards: SP 800-39 complements other NIST standards and guidelines, providing a holistic view of risk management1.
 -Applicability: While primarily designed for federal information systems, the principles and practices can be applied by any organization seeking to improve its information security risk management2.

Threat Modelling:

Threat modeling is a structured process used to identify, assess, and address potential security threats to a system or application. Here are the key aspects:

Purpose:
The main goal is to understand the security risks and vulnerabilities within a system and to develop strategies to mitigate these risks1.

Process:
Identify Assets: Determine what needs protection, such as data, systems, or applications.

Create an Architecture Overview:
Diagram the system to understand how data flows and where potential vulnerabilities might exist.
Identify Threats:
Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to categorize potential threats2.
Mitigate Threats:
Develop and implement strategies to reduce or eliminate identified threats.
Validate:
Continuously review and update the threat model to ensure it remains effective as the system evolves3.

Benefits:
Early Risk Identification:
Helps identify security issues early in the development process, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
Improved Security Awareness:
Encourages a security-first mindset among developers and stakeholders2.
Enhanced System Understanding:
Provides a deeper understanding of the system’s architecture and potential attack vectors2.

Applications:
Threat modeling can be applied to various domains, including software applications, networks, IoT devices, and business processes1.

Types:
STRIDE Model(Spoofing,Tampering,Repudiation,Information Disclosure,Denial of Service (DoS),Elevation of Privilege)

Diamond:
Breaks down an intrusion event into four key components.

 -Adversary:
The individual or group responsible for the attack. This could be a hacker, a criminal organization, or even a nation-state.
 -Infrastructure:
The tools and resources used by the adversary to carry out the attack. This includes servers, malware, and communication channels.
 -Capability:
The methods and techniques used by the adversary. This could involve specific types of malware, phishing tactics, or other attack vectors.
 -Victim:
The target of the attack, which could be an individual, organization, or system.
These components are interconnected, forming a diamond shape that helps analysts understand the relationships and dynamics of an intrusion12.

How It Works:
 -Event: 
At the center of the diamond is the event, which is the actual occurrence of the intrusion.
- Meta-Features:
Additional details such as timestamps, geolocation, and other contextual information that provide deeper insights into the event.
 -Benefits:
Comprehensive Analysis: By examining each component, analysts can gain a thorough understanding of the attack.
 -Improved Mitigation:
Understanding the adversary’s methods and infrastructure helps in developing effective defense strategies.
 -Enhanced Communication:
The model provides a common language for discussing and documenting threats.

Information Security Governance:

Overview:

Policies:
Definition: A high-level statement that outlines an organization’s intentions and direction regarding specific issues.

Example:
 -A company policy might state that all employees must protect confidential information.

Standards:
Definition: Specific, measurable requirements that must be met to comply with a policy.

Example:
 -Password Policy specifiy a certain complexity.

Procedures:
Detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to implement policies and standards.

Example:
 -A procedure might outline the steps for creating a secure password, including how to reset it if forgotten.
