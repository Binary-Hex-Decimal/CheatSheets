What is Cyber security Risk:
Cybersecurity risk refers to the potential loss or damage resulting from a cyberattack or data breach. It involves identifying and assessing threats and vulnerabilities within an organizationâ€™s digital systems and networks. 

Examples:
Ransomware
Malware
Insider threats
Phishing attacks

Risk Assesment Approaches:

Avoid:
 -Avoiding Untrusted Software.
 -Zero-Trust permissions.
 -Network Segmentation i.e Vlan.

Mitigate:
 -Risk Assessments
 -Implement Network Access Controls i.e MFA,Zero-Trust permissions.
 -Regular Software Updates.
 -Employee Training.
 -Encryption: Protect sensitive data by encrypting it both in transit and at rest.
 -Backup Data.
 -Monitor and Respond.
 -Implement Security Policies.

Transfer:
 -Outsourcing certain IT or security functions to third-party providers i.e MSP,Cloud etc.
 -Cyber Insurance: Purchasing insurance policies that cover financial losses from cyber incidents, including data breaches, legal fees, and recovery costs.

Accept:
 -Accepting the residual risk after implementing all feasible security controls. This is a strategic decision based on a thorough risk assessment.
 -Accept risks that are low-impact, have a low likelihood of occurring, or when the cost of mitigation is too high compared to the potential damage1.
 -Legacy Systems: Continuing to use older systems that are costly to upgrade but have minimal exposure to critical threats.
 -Review and Reassessment: Regularly review accepted risks to ensure they remain within acceptable levels and reassess them as the threat landscape evolves2.
