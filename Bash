IP SCAN:

-d = delimeter
-f = feild
4 = nth value

Cat a file for a space and keep the 4th value after the 4th space and remove any trailing value with tr:
cat "file" | grep " " | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d "value to remove"

ipsweep.sh

Execute:
./ipsweep.sh 192.168.4 > output.tx

Code IPsweep.sh:
!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" == "" ]
then
echo "you forgot an IP address!"
echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.4"
else
for ip in `sequence 1 254`; do
ping -c $1.$ip" | grep "Value" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d "value to remove"  &
done
fi

Take a list of IP and run nmap:
for ip in $(cat output.txt); do nmap $ip; done
